January/February always feels like a time of transtion, a time to take stock and reflect before gradually easing us into the new year.

In the studio things are blooming and growing at a pace.

At the beginning of January my husband gave me a huge bouquet of brightly coloured flowers to celebrate our wedding day.

As an ex florist I was at first taken aback by the colour scheme, the clash of bold colours and odd mixture of blooms both assualted and delighted the senses.

They exuded a joyful vibe, particularly at a dark time of year both seasonally and emotionally and especially as we had just entered our second lockdown.

since then the flowers appear to be blooming across my studio walls recreating my own imaginary flower shop.

Painted quickly with a wet on wet technique I  have tried to capture the essence of each bloom before they die.

If you would like further details of any of these works, prices start fom £50 -£150 please email me.
