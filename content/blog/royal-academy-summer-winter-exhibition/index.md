I am happy to announce that "Plantation house" made it into the postponed Royal Academy Summer/Winter Exhibition, the photo is of myself on varnishing day. Its been a long held dream of mine to show my work there with several pieces over the years shortlisted but didn't quite make the final edit. After the lockdown restriction it was great to finally see some art on walls and catch up with fellow artists.

"The plantation lay hidden in plain site behind large doors and just yards from the luxury beach resort.Our guide took us into the jungle in which he had fashioned ropes used to climb up to the elevated and abandoned facade of the owners plantation house. Reclaimed by nature the house still held the traces of its dark past.

I initially collected henna leaves from the surrounding area which i crushed to release the dye used to sketch the house, leaving my fingers stained an inky red. As well as oil paints I used non naturalistic colours to highlight the plight of those forgotten.
