Weary Harold, the Byronic hero from the epic poem, Childe Haroldâ€™s Pilgrimage, has been both venerated and ridiculed through the ages for his ambitious longing for adventure, connection and purpose. He travels the world in a quest for meaning beyond life's shallow pleasures yet is often left unfulfilled. Upon discovering relics of war and empire in every country, Harold is nostalgic for a place that no longer exists and is left to ruminate on the acquiescent beauty of what remains. This is where our exhibition takes place- looking to the spaces between weary and wonder; familiar and fatigued, experience and exploit.
