    Hello and welcome to my website.
     I am an artist with a love of colour and an eye for detail, my unique visual language is defined by poetic observations of the natural world. It is important to me to be connected to nature on a daily basis and to observe the rhythms of the seasons.
     My artworks reflect this love I have for our natural world which I hope you will also enjoy.
