 *My grandmother's roses started my love of almost everything I hold dear to my heart; gardens, family, painting, dreaming and getting lost amongst the flowers.*

*Growing up on the edge of the Lancashire moorland, my grandmother’s garden was an oasis in an otherwise barren landscape.*

*My latest body of work continues my ongoing investigations into the role of the garden as a place of sanctuary. The term garden refers to an enclosed space set apart from untamed nature, a sacred place sheltered from the outside world.*

*My paintings are not a portrait of one singular landscape, but rather a combination of many, an intuitive non naturalistic colour palette references a mood and explores the margins between control and nature whilst an undercurrent of environmental issues flows throughout my work.*

*I incorporate various symbolic elements such as water which alludes to purity, the secret language of flowers, and paths that signify journey’s taken or yet to be undertaken.*

*As an avid horticulturist and ex florist, I have cultivated a garden however small wherever I have lived which I then recreate within my large-scale immersive oil paintings, enticing the viewer into my fantastical world.*

*In my latest series of watercolour studies on Fabriano paper my aim is to show not only the diverse range of our British wildflowers but also highlight the loss of green spaces.*

*It is in the shift between what is remembered and imagined that the works take shape, a dichotomy of fragility and preservation.*
