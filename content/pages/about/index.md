As a shy child I could always be found digging in the dirt in my grandmothers garden, hidden amongst my beloved plants and flowers. I also loved the colouring books in which you added water to a seemingly blank page and colours and images would appear as if by magic. Its a technique I still use today, especially with my inks and watercolours, drawing first with clear water then dropping colour onto the page to see what appears.

I entered Bolton School of Art aged just 13, Art was a way to make my voice heard. After leaving school I studied floristry and had a brief career as a textile designer which gave me a love of pattern, colour and light found within plants and flowers.

I look for the connections between my experiences whilst in nature and how they relate to me as a woman and my place in the world. The initial meaning of an experience may not reveal itself and remain hidden for some time, perhaps until an oil painting is complete and its true significance is unearthed. 

The resulting paintings are therefore a mix of a factual record of a moment in time and an emotional response to being in a particular place. It is in the shift between what is remembered and imagined that the works take shape, a dichotomy of fragility and preservation. 

Julie Moss lives and works in Cornwall and studied Fine Art at Falmouth University.
