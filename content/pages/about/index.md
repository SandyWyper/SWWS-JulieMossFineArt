My grandmother’s roses are what started my love of pretty much everything I hold dear to my heart; gardens, painting, family, dreaming and getting lost amongst the flowers.

I love magical spaces which seem to be elevated out of the ordinary, timeless places which are perhaps slightly overgrown and hidden from view and need to be protected.

As a child I loved the colouring books with blank pages which when you applied water colours would appear as if by magic to reveal an image.\
It’s a technique I still use today when I sketch with my ink brushes, drawing with water first then allowing the coloured inks to meander across the paper until an image starts to form.

The immediacy and tactility of oils and inks dictates my choice of materials whilst colour and light are used to express emotion.\
My oil paintings provide a continuous journey of revelation and discovery, with the hidden, ephemeral and transient the constant thread that ties it all together. I am interested in threshold spaces where transitional states of being come into play: the interior and exterior such as doorways, greenhouses and windows.

The resulting paintings are a mix of a factual record of a moment in time and an emotional response to being in a particular place.\
It is in the shift between what is remembered and imagined that the works take shape, a dichotomy of fragility and preservation.
